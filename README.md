# Disaster Tweet Classification

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. So to make sure that the safety teams respond to the right tweets more often than the ones that might not be disaster related in an automated way an NLP based model is designed in order to attain this.

In order to attain best accuracy I cleaned the text using NLTK and Regex libraries of python. For classification i used the BERT model using pytorch. 

At the time of creating this repository I rank 167/3819 teams. [Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/leaderboard)
